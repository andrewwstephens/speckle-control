By default, ds9 will no longer create regions when it starts; that is, clicking in the ds9 window will not create a region. This is because the ds9 interface has changed in version 7.3.2, as noted above, so that it no longer starts in region editing mode.

    To create or edit regions, users must now manually switch to Region mode by selecting

    Edit → Region

    from the menu bar or the button bar.

    Users can make this the default by editing their preferences:

    Edit → Preferences ...
    Menus and Buttons                  (left panel)
    Edit → Menu → Region               (right panel)
    Save
