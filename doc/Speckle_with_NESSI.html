<center><h1><font color="blue">Speckle Imaging at WIYN Using NESSI</font></h1></center>

<br><br>

<center><h2>Overview</h2></center>

<p>The following is a guide to the capabilities of speckle imaging
at WIYN and to preparing a speckle observing program using NESSI.  Speckle
observations using NESSI at WIYN are currently carried out in queue
mode, which operates ~2 times per semester and applied for through
the NN-Explore program at NOAO.  Speckle queue PI's receive a set of
reduced data products in the month or so following the observations. For
questions not answered here (or if this document is unclear), contact
the support scientist,

<br>
<p>Speckle imaging using the NN-Explore Exoplanet Stellar Speckle
Imager (NESSI) at WIYN provides observers with diffraction-limited
resolutions within small (few arcsec wide) fields.  The two electron
multiplying CCDs (EMCCDs) of NESSI operate simultaneously through
a pair of filters (out of a current choice of 4 specialized speckle
filters).  A common use of speckle imaging has been to detect and
provide relative photometry and astrometry for binary and higher-order
multiple stars.  The relative astrometry, brightnesses and colors from
NESSI data help characterize the components and may be used to measure
visual binary orbits or relative proper motions.  At WIYN, speckle
imaging should reach sensitivities to detect companions at least 3-5
magnitudes fainter than a target star depending on brightness,
exposure time and conditions.  Typically, the time spent integrating 
on a speckle target is 1-20 minutes.

</p><p>A standard speckle observing method and data reduction pipeline has
been developed over the years at WIYN and other telescopes using
NESSI's predecessor instrument, DSSI.  This procedure was employed
during the 2016B speckle queue observations using NESSI.  Once a
target has been acquired, data are taken by reading a subsection of
the full array (for NESSI the window is 256x256 pixels or 4.6x4.6
arcsec, although the speckle imaging works best at separations inside
of ~1.5 arcsec).  Normally the window is centered on the target of
interest.  Images are taken in sets of 1000 frames apiece where each
frame is a 40 millisecond exposure (and each image set requires a
little less than 1 minute
to complete).  To achieve deeper imaging or for faint
targets and poor conditions, multiple image sets are taken.

</p><p>In addition to science targets, at least one bright point source star
in close proximity on the sky is observed using the same techniques.
This point source standard accounts for the shifting PSF as a function
of mount coordinates, airmass and focus.

<br><br>
</p><center><h2>Speckle Data</h2></center>

<p>Data reduction is done using a custom software pipeline run by the
speckle team.  Successful proposers to the speckle queue will receive
4 basic pipeline products for each target in each filter.  The
products were developed as part of projects to detect
previously-unresolved secondary stars or fore- or background sources
near stars of interest and to acquire temporal astrometric
measurements for measuring binary star orbits.  These data products
are probably applicable to a wider variety of programs:

</p><ol>
<li> A reconstructed image at or near the telescope diffraction limit,
centered on the target star.  Sources detected within the field will
show up as bright objects against a noise background (sky,
effectively).
</li><li> An evaluation based on visual inspection of each image (and in
Fourier domain its power spectrum) to determine if there are multiple
sources detected.  When multiple objects are present, their relative
astrometry and photometry are measured.
</li><li> An estimate of the background sensitivity or the minimum
magnitude difference relative to the target star any undetected
sources in the field would have as a function of separation from the
target star.  This may be called a contrast curve.  It is based on
noise statistics in the reconstructed image as measured in a set of
concentric annuli of various radii centered on the target star.  The
product consists of a table listing background limiting magnitude vs.
angular separation.
</li><li> A plot (PDF), showing the background limiting magnitude vs. 
angular separation. 
</li></ol>

<p><a href="https://www.noao.edu/noao/staff/everett/nessi/Speckle_dataproducts.html">See example data products here.</a>

</p><p>Users can ask for the raw data, although this will often be quite
large (~100GB/night) and hasn't been requested by most users.

<br><br>
</p><center><h2>Speckle Performance</h2></center>

<p>The effectiveness of speckle imaging is strongly dependent on
observing conditions, especially seeing.  As a rough guide, NESSI
should be able to operate effectively on stars of V or R magnitude as
faint as 14 under reasonably good conditions.  In excellent
conditions, stars of V=14.5 are observable.  

</p><p>Note that the magnitudes above refer to a "central" target star,
around which fainter companions may be detected.  Faint companions may
be detected down to a background limit, which depends on the seeing
and typically rises in its magnitude difference relative to the
central star with increasing angular separation.  A contrast curve
reaching 5 magnitudes fainter than the central star is achievable for
stars brighter than V=12.  For fainter stars, longer integrations are
used.  Even so, the resulting images are typically less deep.

</p><p>The field-of-view for speckle imaging is limited by the angular size of
the atmosphere's isoplanatic patch.  Speckle patterns of stars
separated by more than ~1 arcsec become uncorrelated, lowering the
sensitivity to detect and measure their relative properties.  For this
reason, DSSI was operated in a 128x128 pixel window (2.8x2.8 arcsec).
For NESSI, which has a somewhat smaller pixel scale, our current plan
is to cover this same field-of-view by observing with a 256x256 pixel
window and provide data products for the inner 2.8x2.8 arcsec box.  As
our software gets refined for the new instrument, these details may
change.

</p><p>Speckle interferometry delivers imaging at or near the telescope
diffraction limit.  The diffraction limit in each speckle filter is
listed in the table below.  Note, however, that these numbers are not
necessarily indicative of the filter choices that will yield the
best-resolved images!  Our ability to construct speckle images with
small inner working angles, push for relatively deep background limits
inside of a few tenths of arcseconds, and resolve (for example) close
binaries, depends on closely matching the PSF of science targets to
point source standards.  Generally, the worse seeing and greater
differential atmospheric diffraction at shorter wavelengths renders
speckle in the bluer filters more difficult and the image quality may
be adversely affected.  For these reasons, the red filters often yield
effectively superior angular resolution.  For similar reasons, targets
that can be observed at low airmass at WIYN will work best.

<br><br>
</p><center><h2>Number of Image Sets to Acquire Per Target</h2></center>

<p>The performance of speckle imaging is quite sensitive to
conditions like seeing, so there are no strict rules to follow for
determining the ideal number of image sets to acquire on a target of
given brightness.

</p><p>Observers targeting stars fainter than V=13 should plan on
acquiring multiple image sets and those observing brighter stars may
also benefit from taking multiple sets.  This will depend on how they
balance better contrast depth/image quality vs. number of targets
visited.  Multiple image sets per star can also help under less than
optimal observing conditions and, given the several minutes needed to
set up observing of each new target, many users may want to devote
comparable time to exposures.

</p><p>Each image set requires 1 minute of telescope time.  Acquiring a
target with a short slew requires 3 minutes and with a long slew, 5
minutes.  Since a science target requires a point source observation,
additional time is needed for that (about 4 minutes).  Refer to the guide
on estimating observing time for more information.

</p><p>Note that we have found the signal-to-noise ratio for detecting
secondary sources in speckle images does not grow as rapidly with
exposure time as it would in traditional CCD imaging (ie. with the
square root of time).  Proposers may not expect to achieve the same
contrast limits on faint stars as bright ones (5 magnitudes may be
achievable on 12th magnitude stars and 3 magnitudes on 14th magnitude
stars.)  The table below only suggests numbers of image sets to take
for various magnitude stars:

<center><h2>Estimating Observing Time</h2></center>

<p>To prepare an observing proposal, you should estimate the time
needed to carry out the observations.  Use the
<a href="https://www.noao.edu/noao/staff/everett/nessi/observing_time.pdf">guide to estimating observing time
(PDF)</a> for help with that.

</p><p>If you're unsure how to estimate your observing time or the guide
doesn't seem to apply to your project, contact the support scientist
for help.

<br><br>
</p><center><h2>Filter Transmission &amp; Efficiency Curves</h2></center>

<p>NESSI uses a dichroic beamsplitter to separate the incoming light (at
686nm) into blue and red channels before focusing on the two identical
cameras, which operate simultaneously.  The speckle filter choice will
be one of 467nm or 562nm paired with one of 716nm or 832nm.  NESSI's
SDSS filters are also listed below (although not used for speckle imaging).
Data are in nanometers and fractional efficiencies as quoted by the
manufacturer.

</p><center><h2>Coordinates List</h2></center>

<p>In addition to the usual information included in observing
proposals, proposers to the speckle queue must submit a coordinate
list sufficient to carry out the program.  The coordinate list can be
altered and resubmitted close to the observing date if the nature of
the program warrants it and new objects are in keeping with the
proposal's science.  In some cases, where target lists have been
submitted with your proposal, we may take those coordinates as a
starting point and check with PIs to make sure they are finalized and
whether there are special instructions.  The speckle coordinate lists
are <b>not</b> submitted to the Kitt Peak Coordinate Cache system (which
the speckle program does not use), but rather are plain text format
files which can be emailed to the support scientist, Mark Everett.

</p><p>In addition to science targets, point source standards will need to
be observed.  <b>It is likely easiest for the speckle queue team to
pick good point sources for you, which we will do if you don't provide
them.</b>  In any case, an estimate for the time required to carry out
your observing program should include the time needed to observe the
point source standards.  The best point source standards are HR stars
of 5-6th V magnitude within 5 degrees of each science target, and
which are thought to be single.  For efficient slewing, the science
target and its associated point source should both lie either north or
south of 31.96 degrees declination, the zenith at WIYN.

</p><p>During a typical night, nearby science targets from different queue
proposals will be observed sequentially and may share
a single point source standard observation for their calibration.

</p><p><b>Your coordinate list should be provided at least a few weeks
prior to the observing run.</b>  You may be contacted by the support
scientist to ensure that we have your list and additional instructions
to carry out your program.

</p><p>A proper coordinate list should include a target name, RA &amp; DEC
(equinox and epoch 2000), a V or R magnitude measurement or estimate,
and any significant proper motions in RA and DEC.  Note that with the
small speckle field-of-view, it is important for us to correctly
identify your targets!  To that end, it can be helpful if the
target name is identifiable to the observer using SIMBAD or other
online sources of information such as Exofop, that in certain crowded
fields finding charts could be helpful and that proper motions are
needed only if they are rather large (e.g., target moved more than a
few arcsec since 2000).  If you have a priority order or ranking for
your targets, or special instructions for different targets, it would
be helpful if you indicate these things in your coordinates list.

</p><p>A example coordinate list of 3 objects listing RA, DEC, Vmag, pmRA
and pmDEC in milliarcsec/year respectively (if you use a comparable
format, e.g., hexidecimal coordinates, it will be helpful):

</p><pre>HIP 1	     00:00:00.22 +01:05:20.4 9.08 -4.55 -1.19
HIP 40617    08 17 31.65 +08 51 58.7 6.3
